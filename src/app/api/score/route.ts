CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze EACH PATENT INDIVIDUALLY against the problem statement
2. ALL SIX CATEGORIES must be evaluated in the context of the problem statement - not just Strategic Relevance
3. Compare each patent's performance in EVERY CATEGORY relative to the specific problem described
4. Score each patent independently based on how well it addresses the stated problem across all dimensions
5. Do NOT average scores across patents - each patent gets its own individual assessment
6. EVERY rationale must reference how the patent relates to solving the specific problem

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 90-100: Outstanding/Exceptional - Clear competitive advantage, strong protection, high commercial potential
- 75-89: Strong - Solid patent with good potential, some advantages
- 50-74: Average - Decent patent but limited advantages or unclear potential  
- 25-49: Weak - Significant limitations or concerns
- 0-24: Very Poor - Major flaws or minimal value

For each category, provide detailed rationales (50-120 words) that:
1. EXPLICITLY connect the patent to the problem statement in EVERY category
2. Quote specific evidence from the provided patent information
3. Explain how this patent addresses the problem within this specific category
4. Justify the numeric score given based on problem-solving capability
5. Compare this patent's performance to what would be ideal for solving the stated problem
6. Note any missing information that affects scoring

CATEGORY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE - ALL CATEGORIES MUST CONSIDER THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- Strategic Relevance: How well does THIS SPECIFIC PATENT address the problem statement? Consider direct application to the problem, scope of solutions it provides, and market alignment with the stated need.
- Technical Strength: Evaluate THIS PATENT's technical claims and methods IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT. How strong are the technical solutions for addressing the specific problem? Consider claim quality, innovation level, and implementation feasibility for solving the stated problem.
- Legal Durability: Assess THIS PATENT's legal protection strength RELATIVE TO THE PROBLEM DOMAIN. Consider family breadth, claim strength, and enforceability specifically for protecting solutions to the stated problem.
- Market Leverage: Evaluate THIS PATENT's commercial advantages FOR THE PROBLEM AREA. Consider industry impact, revenue opportunities, and competitive positioning specifically within the market segment defined by the problem statement.
- Freedom to Operate: Assess design-around difficulty and blocking potential WITHIN THE PROBLEM SPACE. How central is this patent's approach to solving the stated problem? How easily can competitors work around it while still addressing the same problem?
- Licensing Feasibility: Evaluate licensing potential CONSIDERING THE PROBLEM CONTEXT. How attractive would this patent be for licensing to companies trying to solve the stated problem? Consider ownership clarity and commercial value for the specific problem domain.
